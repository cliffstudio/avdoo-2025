# Integrations
Formie provides a number of integrations with third-party services for a variety of additional functionality and features.

## Captchas
Captchas are an important part of spam-protection for forms. Formie provides 4 captcha mechanisms, for further detail read the [Captcha](docs:integrations/captchas) docs.

## Address Providers
Address Providers allow [Address](docs:feature-tour/fields#address) fields to use third-party services to autocomplete addresses. This has a significant benefit of lowering user input errors for users filling out a form. Includes Google Places, Address Finder, Loqate and more.

For further detail read the [Address Provider](docs:integrations/address-providers) docs.

## Elements
Element integrations allow form submissions to populate other elements, upon form submission success. Includes Entries and Users.

For further detail read the [Element](docs:integrations/elements) docs.

## Email Marketing
Email Marketing integrations allow form submissions to send third-party providers a payload to subscribe an email to a nominated list. You can pick a field to allow users to opt-in to subscribing. You‘ll have control over what fields should be mapped to any custom fields on the third-party system. Includes Mailchimp, Campaign Monitor, Constant Contact, ActiveCampaign and more.

For further detail read the [Email Marketing](docs:integrations/email-marketing) docs.

## CRM
CRM integrations allow form submissions to send third-party providers a payload to integration user data into their system. Each CRM provider handles data differently, but Formie‘s integrations attempt to import “Contacts” and “Leads” into the CRM platform. You‘ll have control over what fields should be mapped to their third-party counterparts.  Includes ActiveCampaign, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, Zoho and more.

For further detail read the [CRM](docs:integrations/crm) docs.

## Payments
Create payment forms with Payment integrations! You'll be able to create payment fields (most commonly credit card inputs) for users of the form to enter. Perfect for creating a paywall, capturing registration payment, invoicing and more. For some payment providers, you can even create subscriptions. Includes Stripe and PayPal.

For further detail read the [Payments](docs:integrations/payments) docs.

## Webhooks
Webhook integrations are primarily used for when an external URL needs to be sent a payload of data from Formie, for processing on the receiving end. Includes Zapier and custom Webhooks.

For further detail read the [Webhooks](docs:integrations/webhooks) docs.

## Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous integrations are just that - any integration that doesn't fit into the categories above, but are still considered an integration. Includes Google Sheets, Slack, Trello and more.

For further detail read the [Miscellaneous](docs:integrations/miscellaneous) docs.
